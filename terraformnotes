8. Install Git-Bash on windows ----DONE
9. Check in VSCode - in Terminal you should be able to use GitBash along with PowerShell ---DONE
10. Reference folder created as per course - C:\Users\Aditya\source
11. Terraform (basic) commands:
	1. **terraform init** 
		initializes the current working directory. 
		This created the ".terraform" folder and ".terraform.lock.hcl" file.
	2. **terraform plan** 
	3. **terraform apply**  
		Applies your changes and creates the terraform.tfstate file. 
		This command actually provisions what you need. 
	4. **terraform destroy** 
		Destroys the infra or resources you have created after confirmation.
12. **Input Variables**:
		Mechanism by which we can pass in values to terraform.
		Adds the ability to customize your terraform module.
		As a best practice put all your input variables in "variables.tf" file.
13. Remember:
		When you write Terraform for Azure - it only works on Azure
		When you write Terraform for AWS - it only works on AWS.
		Terraform supports multiple cloud platforms but the above 2 statements also hold true.
		Udemy - Terraform 101 Ultimate Hands on Guide ---Lecture3
		**Immutability** - 
				Its a simple concept about whether something can be updated, changed, manipulated in place, or whether something has to be deleted & recreated.
				Example:- 
				A polaroid picture is an immutable artifact 
				whereas 
				A white board can be considered as mutable (since we can rewrite on it as many times).
14. **Local variables**:
		Defined inside your Terraform configuration.
		Convenient for storing reusable constants or intermediate values
15. **Outputs**:
		Allow us to extract values out of terraform from all the resources & things that Terraform has provisioned, & within our infrastructure to pass it forward to other tools that might be part of our automation pipeline like Ansible or K8s.
			Terraform command - **terraform output**
		Outputs are defined in the "outputs.tf" file.
		Outputs are extremely valuable specially when using Terraform with other tools like Ansible, K8s etc.

16. Login with Azure CLI:
		From CMD -> az --version  (to check if the cli package is installed)
		From CMD -> az login  (log in with you aws gmail id)
		From CMD -> az login --tenant TENANT_ID  (check your tenant id on Azure portal)
17. Configure Azure terraform provider:
		From URL - https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest
		Upgraded terraform azure provider from v4.1.0 to v4.45.0
			az account list
			az account show 
18. What is provider in Terraform?
		In Terraform, a **provider** is a plugin that acts as the bridge between Terraform and the APIs of a cloud platform, SaaS, or other service.

	It tells Terraform **how to authenticate** and **how to create, read, update, and delete resources** on that service.
	The **AzureRM provider** lets Terraform manage resources in **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**.
19. **Encapsulation** in Terraform:
		Its one of the core principles of OOPs
		In software engineering, **encapsulation** means grouping related functionality together and hiding internal details so that only a clean interface is exposed.
		In Terraform, encapsulation mainly comes from using **modules**.
	 Terraform module is a container for multiple resources that are used together. By wrapping resources inside a module, you:
		Expose only input variables and output values (the interface).    
		Hide implementation details like individual resources, naming conventions, or conditional logic.    
		Allow reusability—modules can be shared across teams or projects.
	### Benefits of Encapsulation in Terraform:
	-> Hides Complexity – Users don’t see resource-level details.    
	-> Reusability – The same module can be used in multiple projects.    
	-> Consistency – Teams enforce best practices in one module and reuse it.    
	-> Security – Internals (like naming, tags, IAM policies) can be hidden.    
	-> Maintainability – Change internals without breaking user-facing interface.
20. Cohesion in Terraform:
		In Terraform, cohesion applies mostly to how you structure **modules**.
		A cohesive Terraform module should:
	- Have a **single, clear purpose** (e.g., "create an S3 bucket with security settings" or "deploy a VPC with subnets").    
	- Include **all the resources necessary to fulfill that purpose**.    
	- Avoid mixing unrelated responsibilities (e.g., don’t create a VPC _and_ an EKS cluster in the same module).
21. Declarative versus Imperative:
		Terraform is Declarative.
22. Terraform.io - Go to Provider - Azure - azurerm documentation - search for storage - "azurerm_storage_account"
23. Command to check workspace - 
		"terraform workspace list" -----------(check current workspace)
		"terraform workspace new dev"  -----(creates a new workspace called dev & switches to that workspace)
		"terraform workspace select <workspace-name>" -------(switch the workspace)

24. The below commands were used to apply changes based on Dev and Prod environment. It created 2 separate resource groups , one for dev & one for prod.
	terraform apply -var-file ./env/dev.tfvars 
	terraform apply -var-file ./env/prod.tfvars
25. While creating the storage account via terraform, Imp thing to note here was usage of random provider to generate the storage account name string.
26. Providers translate Terraform code into API calls to the target system. Providers are listed in the versions.tf file. In Terraform, a provider is like a plugin or module that knows how to interact with a specific platform, service, or API.
27. A workspace in Terraform is like a separate state environment for the same configuration.
- Each workspace has its own Terraform state file.
 
- The same Terraform code can be applied to multiple workspaces, resulting in separate sets of infrastructure.
28. What is **Idempotence** in Terraform?
A. Running the same Terraform code **multiple times** will always give you the **same result**, without making unnecessary changes.

For example:
- If Terraform has already created your server, running `terraform apply` again won’t create another one—it will detect that the server already exists and leave it as is.
    
- Terraform only makes changes when something in your configuration or the real-world resources is different.
